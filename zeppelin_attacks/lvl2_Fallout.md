# Fallout

### Goal
Claim ownership (set owner variable to player)

### Approach
This one is rather straight-forward. The contract creator has made a mistake here, misspelling the function that had to be the constructor function (Fal1out instead of Fallout). --- This is now a deprecated way to setting a contructor. Currently, this is done by constructor() instead of using the contract name as a function name. --- This means that this function (Fal1out) is just a regular, public function which we can call.

```
contract.Fal1out();
``` 

### Resolution
Use the constructor() style and make sure all public/external functions have the correct modifiers.
